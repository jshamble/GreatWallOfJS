Gesamtkunstwerk!
It's time for me to (quite literally) begin a new chapter in my life.
I have been interested in cultures, traditions, people, and mythologies from around the world
for quite some time now, and have collected many stories during my travels. In this work, my main wish is to
showcase the beauty of people and their cultures from around the world. (Can you guess which ones inspired me?)
I wholeheartedly hope you enjoy reading the adventures as much as I do creating them.

Oracle Bone Script
Many moons ago, the legends fortell of a great king,
who created bones with mysterious symbols etched on them...
/
it has been said that whomever posesses these bones can
rule over all the lands,
scuplting the earth, skies and seas as they please.
/
However, he quickly realized 
too much power is not meant for one being,
so it was decided to create a balance of power
for these entities.
/
He decided to call this system...
/
The Sexagenary Cycle
/
Every 60 years there would be
a race between 12 friends
to determine who would control the bones.
This race is called the Zodiac Race...
/
The contestants, the Zodiacs,
live all across the lands,
and are hurriedly heading to their destination
as the race is about to begin.
/
Places like forgotten forests,
where for many years, not a single plant has grown...
/
To Mechanical Manifestations,
whose true purpose is yet to be known.
/
From Illuminated Islands,
with hidden treasures, far greater than one can dream...
/
To Cavernous Cathedrals,
whose halls echo a fair maiden's gleam.
/
A Mysterious Metropolis,
whose slums have many secrets to tell...
/
What Adventures await such
creatures in these locations dwell?
/
We now join a contestant in the race,
hurrying to his destination as the next race begins soon...
/
A quiet, peaceful day 
in the mountain of flower and fruit...
/
Ugh... my head hurts...
/
MY SHIP... It's ruined!
/
Not even a single banana left...
/
This is not good!
I'll be late to the race!
/
I've got to find some rations and get going...
I'm always late to the party.
/
Aha! 
The plumpest pear!
/
It seems that our zodiac friend has got his bananas
up in a bunch... but enough about him for now... 
surely, the main character must be
an admirable, respectable, and reputable fellow...
/
We now join our protagonist at the base of the mountain.
/
Where'd that punk that stole
our stuff run off to?
/
Damn! Looks like they
escaped again. Back to
the caravan, boys.
/
Dang, Another belt.
/
When will I ever find something good?
/
So hungry...
it's too far to walk back to town.
/
Now, where can I find some food around here?
/
Draw your weapon!
/
This is the staff of legends...
weighing at an impressive 17,550 lbs,
I can swing this faster than a baseball bat!
/
Ready to give up yet?
/
It's a long way down...
but... what's this? I see...
/
It looks like I'm no match for your
skills monkey.
/
See you later!
/
Huh... looks like she must've jumped down.
/
Victory!
/
What! But how?
/
It looks like this thing
came in handy after all!
/
and that's that!
/

/
I'll get you for this!
/
The end is in sight!
/
Heh, looks like I win this round.
/
But how?
/
You see, there was a ladybug underneath the cloud...
and I used the dragon staff to propel forward!
/
and now, the taste test!
/
Looking for this?
/
Hey, that's mine,
I won it fair and square!
/
Get back here!
/
I'll get you for this one day!
/
All mine for the keeping!
/
No one has been able to
outsmart the almighty Yan!
/
Lest she forget...
/
This is a Dog-Eat-Dog World!
/
Snap out of it!
This is your chance to escape!
/
Just keep running,
don't look back!
/
I'm almost there,
just a little bit further...
/
Whew, just barely made it!
/
Will monkey ever make his way to the Zodiac Race grounds?
/
Will I be safe here from the danger in town?
/
Who was that Mustachioed Marauder?
/
CH 1. END!
